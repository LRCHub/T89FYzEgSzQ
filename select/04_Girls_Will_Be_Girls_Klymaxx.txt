On the phone calling up my girlfriends
Going out tonight
('Cause tonight is ladies' night)

I like this guy
Met him at the disco
He'll be there tonight
(And we're gonna have a ball)

I wonder if he wants me
Wants to wine and dine
(If he wants to wine and dine)
I wonder if he's able to show a girl good times

You know how women love to dress up, fellas
They want to impress as you can see
Grls will be girls

With make-up, nails and fancy hair
We want to get another stare from fellas
Girls will be girls

Brand new dress
Thought I'd better impress
Hope it's worth my time
(Yes, this guy is mighty fine)

Fix my hair
Have to look my very best
Wanna look just right
(If he's gonna be mine)

Wanna know if he's charming
If he's witty
Has he had success
(Wonder if he's got some cash)

Have to let a man think that
He's catching while I make my catch
(Make him feel like a man)

I wonder if he'll take me to my door tonight
(Take me to my door tonight)
And if he wants to visit
Will it be all right

You know how women love to dress up, fellas
They want to impress as you can see
Grls will be girls

With make-up, nails and fancy hair
We want to get another stare from fellas
Girls will be girls

You know how women love to dress up, fellas
They want to impress as you can see
Grls will be girls

With make-up, nails and fancy hair
We want to get another stare from fellas
Girls will be girls
